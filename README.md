# BA_customer_bookings

Another job simulation from theforage.com that British Airway Data scientist wrangle with. It focuses on predictive modeling to analyze and forecast customer booking behavior using machine learning techniques. The dataset contains various features related to flight bookings, including sales channels, trip types, flight details, and passenger preferences.

The analysis begins with exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand trends, distributions, and key patterns within the dataset. Feature engineering is applied to transform categorical and numerical variables for better model performance. Two machine learning models—Logistic Regression and Random Forest Classifier—are trained and evaluated using key metrics such as accuracy, AUC score, and classification reports.

Additionally, the project identifies the most influential factors affecting booking completion through feature importance analysis. Visualizations are used to interpret the data, and a final report is generated to highlight model performance and key takeaways.

This predictive modeling approach can be utilized in the airline industry to improve booking strategies, optimize marketing efforts, and enhance customer experience.
